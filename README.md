# ApsBulletMuzzleEnergy
Muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm.

E = 1/2 x (M x V²) ÷ K

where:

K = 450,435 and is derived from (2 x 32.1739 x 7000)

M is the weight of the projectile, in grains

V is the velocity in feet per second

E is the energy in foot pounds.
